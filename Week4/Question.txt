Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is the key.

Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter the letter a.

Sample Input: 
string = 'xyz'
key = 2

Sample Output
'zab'


Sample Input: 
string = 'abc'
key = 3

Sample Output
'def'
